Behooked is an open source webhooks service that allows clients to register webhooks for one or more events. Upon successful registration, clients will receive a notification each time the event occurs. 

- The Webhook API allows you to administrate webhooks. 

- The Trigger API allows you to administrate triggers and thus define for which type of events you would like to offer a webhook.

- The Event API allows you to receive event notifications from a source system.

  - A kafka-connector is available for you to receive event notification from a Kafka cluster.

# project-description

Behooked is an open source webhooks service. It allows clients to register webhooks for one or more events. Once a registration is completed clients receive a notification each time the event occurs. To administrate webhooks Behooked offers a RESTful API. The Trigger API allows you to administrate triggers and thus define for which type of events you would like to offer a webhook. The Event API allows you to receive event notifications from a source system. Moreover the kafka-connector allows you to receive event notification from a Kafka cluster.
